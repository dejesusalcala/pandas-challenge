Some of the information provided in the data includes the name of each high school, the reading score and math score of each student, the grade of each student, the budget the school, and the size of each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of overrall passing the charter schools had a higher propotion of students that passed both math and reading. In fact, every single charter had a higher overall passing percentage than the district schools. \n",

    "- It was also interesting to see that in terms of spending the schools that had a lower budget per capita were the schools that had a higher of average of students passing both math and reading. \n",

    "- The smaller and medium sized schools also out-performed the larger schools in having more students that passed both math and reading. The large schools had an average of about 54% of students that passed both math and reading while the small and medium-sized schools both had an average of about 84% of students that passed both math and reading.\n",
